<h1>Tee's Methods</h1>

<p>This repository is documenting my journey to understand callbacks, closures, and functional programming in general.  
I'll be uploading my attempts at re-creating popular JS methods and even write new ones that could help with future 
web application development.</p>

<h2> Code on!</h2>
