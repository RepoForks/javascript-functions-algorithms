<h1>Tee's Methods</h1>

<p>I am documenting my journey to understand callbacks, closures, and functional programming in general by writing my own functions, which can be binded as methods.  I'll be uploading my attempts at re-creating popular JS methods and even write new ones that could help with future web application development.</p>
