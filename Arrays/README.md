<h1>Array manipulation fun!</h1>

This folder contains array manipulation utility functions and algorithms that I have written and solved.  It's so fun learning how to manipulate collections!

I have learned a lot re-writing popular Underscore library methods and Array.prototype methods such as map, filter, reduce, and forEach.
